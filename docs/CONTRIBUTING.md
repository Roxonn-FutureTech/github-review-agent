## Logging Guidelines

When adding new code, follow these logging practices:

1. Always use the project's logging system:
   ```python
   from ai_engine.logging_config import get_logger
   
   logger = get_logger(__name__)
   ```

2. Use appropriate log levels:
   - ERROR: For errors that prevent normal operation
   - WARNING: For unexpected but handled situations
   - INFO: For significant events in normal operation
   - DEBUG: For detailed debugging information

3. Include relevant context in log messages:
   ```python
   logger.info(f"Processing file: {filename}")
   logger.error(f"Failed to parse {filename}", extra={'error': str(e)})
   ```

4. Log files are stored in the `logs` directory with automatic rotation

* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Include integration tests where necessary
* Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests
